In the field of software engineering, it is very common to encounter challenges that require seeking help from others, often through online sites like StackOverflow. However, not all questions are created, as the way a question is asked can greatly affect the quality and quantity of the responses received. Effective communication is a crucial skill for software engineers, especially when requesting assistance from the online community. In Eric Raymond’s essay, How to Ask Questions the Smart Way, he outlines important strategies for framing questions in a way that encourages helpful and meaningful responses. By mastering the art of asking “smart” questions, software engineers can gain better insights and improve their overall communication with their peers. 
In this essay, I will compare two questions from StackOverflow, one that demonstrates the “smart” approach to asking questions and one that demonstrates a “not so smart” approach, as outlined in Eric's essay. Some key factors mentioned in the essay regarding the “smart” approach include conducting thorough research before asking, being clear and concise, providing sufficient context, and demonstrating effort in attempting to solve the problem.
	


Example of a Smart Question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60174/how-can-i-prevent-sql-injection-in-php


This question is a great example of asking questions the smart way. The user asks, “How can I prevent SQL injection in PHP?”, which is a specific, clear and concise title. The issue of SQL injection is an important one, where there can be security risks if the proper actions are not taken. The user includes relevant code and explains what they want to fix. The user also demonstrates understanding of the problem and seeks a specific solution, so they do have some background knowledge in the issue. The question also received many upvotes and a lot of community engagement, showing that it was well-asked and interesting to others. Overall, the question was straightforward, concise, easy to follow and challenging enough where a lot of people wanted to provide their input. The responses to the questions were extremely helpful and detailed, which I am sure helped the user figure out a solution to his problem. The user’s detailed explanation and clear request for help made it easy for the community to provide relevant solutions.

Example of a not smart question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78979561/making-the-text-clickable-inside-the-input-field

In contrast, this question is the “not so smart” way of asking for help. The user asks how to make text inside an input field clickable, but the title and description are vague. The question does not clearly explain the problem or the expected behavior. The user simply says, “I have tried it, but my code is not working,” without specifying what is wrong or what result they are seeing. The user does not provide much context and doesn't say if there are any errors, which makes it hard for anyone to provide a useful solution. Overall, the question is vague, and it doesn't look like this user put much effort into this post or made any effort to understand or fix the problem before asking for help. Even one of the comments pointed these behaviors out and said “ 'My code is not working' is not particularly helpful for debugging. Does it do anything? If so, what, and how does that differ from your expected result?” This indicates that the user’s failure to describe the issue made it hard for others to help effectively.

From these examples, it is clear that asking smart questions leads to much better responses, and is a useful skill to add to your toolkit as a software engineer. The way you phrase a question might not seem like a big deal to most people, but it is very important in the field of software engineering. By following these principles, you can ensure you are asking questions that make it easy for others to help you in the most effective way possible.
