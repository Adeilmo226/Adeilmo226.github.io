## Typescript
This semester was my first time using Typescript and Javascript. I had heard of Javascript as a language used for web development and had always been curious about it, so it was enjoyable to learn and practice using the language. Overall, using Typescript for the first time was not too bad. I just had to get used to the syntax and learn how to use certain data structures that I like using. Having a foundation in javascript and learning that typescript is a superset of javascript made the transition easy for me. It is just a matter of getting more practice and experience with the language before I get really comfortable with it. 

I used a lot of C++ last semester and I feel like the languages are pretty similar, as they both use types, so I felt like that accelerated my learning speed when completing the tutorials. I think Typescript is a good language to use from a software engineering standpoint because being explicit about types is good practice. Especially when working with a group of people, it is easier for them to understand your code if you declare types for functions and variables so they know what's going on and what your code does. 

## Athletic Software Engineering
As for the Athletic Software Engineering approach and the practice WODs, I like the fact that we are practicing athletic software engineering. Athletic software engineering is a learning approach that focuses on improving a programmer's skills through repeated practice and time-constrained coding exercises. I know getting better at this skill will help me become a better programmer and help me prepare for technical interviews as well, which was a goal of mine this semester. 

A lot of software engineering jobs require technical interviews which include completing a certain technical problem, similar to the ones on LeetCode, in a certain amount of time, and then explaining your work to the person interviewing you. The practice WODs I did were not too bad, but I did struggle more than I anticipated on the first real WOD we completed in class. Most likely due to performance anxiety and just inexperience, but I am confident I will get better at them as the semester progresses. It was stressful at first because I thought we only had 5-10 minutes to complete it, but that was not the case, so I will be more prepared and less stressed next time because I know what to expect now. 

Ok
