SpotMeBro is a web platform designed to help students find gym partners based on their fitness level, experience, and goals. Whether youâ€™re a beginner looking for guidance or an advanced gym-goer looking for a partner to push you to your limits, SpotMeBro aims to make your workout experience more engaging and productive.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to create a fitness matching platform for students that facilitates connections with gym partners. Our objectives were to build a platform that is:

- **Community-Focused**: Connects students with compatible gym partners.  
- **User-Friendly**: Provides a simple, intuitive design with clear navigation.  
- **Secure**: Limits access to users with @hawaii.edu email addresses.  
- **Efficient**: Provides filtering, profile customization, and partner matching.  

The project was developed using modern web development frameworks and agile software engineering best practices.
